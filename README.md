# Project: CV Application
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, a simple CV maker where the user can input their general information, educational background, and work experience then a simple resume is made with the inputted data. This project is helped me explore React JS and if I'm going to be honest, it's tough and it's clear that I need more practice but that is the beauty of starting out something, you learn so much! I'm excited to use React JS more.
